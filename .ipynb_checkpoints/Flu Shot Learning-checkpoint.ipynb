    "Vaccination is one of the most effective public health measures for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. In recent years, there has been the development of vaccines for other pandemics such as COVID-19. Vaccination not only helps individuals who have been immunised but also the community from the wider spread of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this study, we are using data from a survey conducted in 2009 during the H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known as the \"swine flu\". This led to an estimated death toll worldwide in its first year of between 151,000 and 575,000. To reduce this, a vaccine was introduced in late 2009 alongside the seasonal flu that was already available.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The survey was used to understand the uptake of both vaccines. These included respondents sharing information on their health conditions, demographics, risk perception, and behaviours. By analyzing this dataset, we can better understand which factors influenced vaccine uptake. These insights can help healthcare professionals design more effective, targeted campaigns to improve vaccine acceptance and coverage in future pandemics."
